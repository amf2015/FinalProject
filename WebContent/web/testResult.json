To acquire a lock, a dirty-read query gets the ID, LockOwner, and LockStatus.  If Unlocked, attempt to UPDATE the Resource by (ID, LockOwner) with a newly generated LockOwner and LockStatus of Locked.  Abort and start again if no rows are updated - meaning someone else got there first.  Otherwise, the Lock is held in the READ UNCOMMITTED transaction.  The transaction is needed to allow rollback on client failure/abandon, but the dirty reads avoid locks.\n\nThis seems to me to work great for resources that are independent of each other.  But what must I add to account for a new kind of lock, ResourceGroup?\n\nResourceGroup to Resource is a one-to-many relationship.  Resources can be locked individually, but if the ResourceGroup needs to be locked, then all of the Resources must also be locked.  \n\nLocking a ResourceGroup is a far less frequent need than locking a Resource, so the scheme should be optimized for Resource queries, avoiding requiring joins to ResourceGroup if possible.\n\nI am imagining a scenario where locking a ResourceGroup involves marking the member rows with some flag, but I\u0027m not sure what scheme doesn\u0027t interfere with the original Resource-only scheme.  Part of the problem comes from the UPDATE of a Resource while it is locked (and therefore already UPDATED in another transaction).  I believe that even if the fields are different within the record, the UPDATE will place an UPDATE LOCK on the row, so any lock on ResourceGroup would introduce blocking that we are trying to avoid.  Even if we could do this, how would the ResourceGroup lock acquisition mechanism know when all of the Resources (which may have had locks in process as we began locking their peers) have been released?\n\nThere may be differences in this locking granularity by RDBMS, I\u0027m on MS SQL 2005+.\n","viewCount":283,"score":5,"creationDate":"2012-05-21T13:22:33.523","acceptedAnswerId":1994,"postTypeId":1,"postId":1974},{"favoriteCount":0,"answerCount":1,"tagList":["distributed-systems","performance","queueing-theory"],"tags":"distributed-systems performance queueing-theory ","postTitle":"What is the size of a queue associated with a resource when the resource becomes a bottleneck?","ownerUserId":22235,"postBody":"In Software Performance and Scalability: A Quantitative Approach - Henry H.

For this example we have three warehouses located at different locations. Each warehouse has a cost of opening ${c_w} \u003d \\{ 7,8,10\\} $ for all $w$. In addition to that, each warehouse provides different resources ${r_1},{r_2}$ or ${r_3}$ required for stores that they have connection to be opened.\n\nEach node in blue color is a store $s \u003d \\{ 1,2,3,4,5\\} $. We have five stores for this example. Each store has its opening cost ${c_s} \u003d \\{ 9,11,12,10,8\\} $ for all $s$. In addition to that each store requires some resources that can be provided by one or more warehouses it is connected to. \n\nEach edge between store and warehouse has some cost. You can think about it as a distance from store location to a warehouse location. Thus, in order to open a store ${s_i}$ it should be connected to one or more warehouses which, together provide resources that ${s_i}$ needs.\n\nThe problem is to find a subset of possible warehouses, a subset of possible stores, and a plan to serve each open store by a list of connected open warehouses. Our goal is to compute the total profit from opened stores minus the total cost from opening warehouses and servicing open stores using those open warehouses is maximized.\n\nFor this example, the optimal plan:\n\n\nOpen $w \u003d 1$, provide ${r_1}$ to $s \u003d 1$, then open it.\nOpen $w \u003d 2$, provide $\\{ {r_1},{r_2}\\} $ to $s \u003d 2$, then open it.\nOpen $s \u003d 3$, by providing resources from $w \u003d \\{ 1,2\\} $\n\n\nThus, we opened 2 warehouses $w \u003d \\{ 1,2\\} $ that provided resources for $s \u003d \\{ 1,2,3\\} $, which we decided to open and we used only 4 edges. The optimal profit for this example is ${p_{OPT}} \u003d 9 + 11 + 12 - (7 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \u003d 4$\n\nNow the task is to model this problem as mixed integer programming, more specifically i think using binary variables i have to define the objective function and all required constraints, also stating new variables.\n\nI have noticed that each ${r_s}$ can be considered a universe set and each ${r_w}$ or union of ${r_w}$s must cover ${r_s}$. This problem, was definitely, designed with a flavor of set covering. However, it was made more complicated by adding extra constraints. \n\nI need to model this problem as MIP. So far, i managed to determine the objective function and came up with some constraints that allow me to chose edges to warehouses that cover the store resources.\n\nMy objective function:\n$$\\max :\\sum\\nolimits_{i:s} {{c_s}} {z_i} - \\left( {\\sum\\nolimits_{j:w} {{c_w}{y_j} + \\sum\\nolimits_{k:e} {{c_e}{x_k}} } } \\right)$$where ${z_i},{y_j},{x_k}$ - binary values and ${c_e}$ is the cost of edge.\n\nOk, since this example is short i will write my objective function in expanded form so it becomes clear about my notation:\n\nMy objective function (expanded form):\n$\\max :9{z_0} + 11{z_1} + 12{z_2} + 10{z_3} + 8{z_4} - 7{y_0} - 8{y_1} - 10{y_2} - 3{x_{00}} - 5{x_{01}} - 3{x_{02}} - 3{x_{11}} - 4{x_{12}} - 5{x_{13}} - 7{x_{22}} - 6{x_{23}} - 4{x_{24}};$\n\n\n${z_i} \u003d 0$ if we don\u0027t open store $s \u003d i$ and ${z_i} \u003d 1$ otherwise\n${y_i} \u003d 0$ if we don\u0027t open warehouse $w \u003d i$ and ${y_i} \u003d 1$ otherwise\n${x_{ij}}$ means edge from store $j$ to warehouse $i$. \n${x_{ij}} \u003d 0$ if we don\u0027t use it and ${x_{ij}} \u003d 1$ otherwise\n\n\nNow i\u0027m trying to set the following constraints:\n\n\nFor each ${s_i}$, i consider ${r_{{s_i}}} \u003d U$ that is a universe set for which i should cover each element. \nThen i apply $\\sum\\nolimits_{S:v \\in S} {{y_S} \\ge 1,\\,\\,\\forall v \\in U} $, that is i pick 1 element from $U$ and determine which adjacent ${r_{{w_j}}}$ can cover it.\nFor each resource required by store, it is covered by one or more sets from 2.\nThen i ensure that store is opened if all of its resources are covered by reachable warehouse(s)\n\n\nHere is my constraint examples for $s \u003d 2 $.\n\nCase $s \u003d 2$:\n\nDenote ${y_{ij}}$ a warehouse $i$ resource set that covers first element from the resource set of store $j$, ${z_j}$ - opening store $j$, ${r_{kj}}$ - required resource ${r_k}$ from store $j$. All indexes starting from 0. Now i have \n\n$$\\begin{gathered}\n  {y_{01}} + {y_{11}} \\ge1; \\hfill \\\\\n  {y_{11}} \\ge 1; \\hfill \\\\\n  {r_{11}} \\le {y_{01}} + {y_{11}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {r_{11}} \\ge {y_{01}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {r_{11}} \\ge {y_{11}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {r_{21}} \\le {y_{11}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {r_{21}} \\ge {y_{11}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {z_1} \\ge {r_{11}} + {r_{21}} - 1; \\hfill \\\\\n  {z_1} \\le {r_{11}}; \\hfill \\\\\n  {z_1} \\le {r_{21}}; \\hfill \\\\ \n\\end{gathered} $$\n\nIn a first line i determine that ${r_1}$ is contained in ${w_1}$ and ${w_2}$ sets. The second required resource ${r_2}$ is only in  ${w_2}$ set. Then i ensure that either one or both sets cover ${r_1}$ same with ${r_2}$. Finally i want to make sure that store can be opened if all resources can be supplied by warehouse. Now from this point i do something wrong because ${z_i}$ is always 1 if some reachable warehouse(s) can cover all resources. So basically with this encoding the solver always sets ${z_i}$ and i need to somehow link ${z_i}$ with warehouse opening. I guess instead of using ${z_i}$ to check if all resources can be obtained i need to introduce another dummy variable say $a$ and define a constraint something like: $a \\to {\\text{ some }}{w_i}$\n\nAs you can see from my constraints i\u0027m missing a link between ${z_i},{y_j},{x_{ij}}$. I managed to create a set of constraints that answer the question: Can any warehouse or their union cover all resources needed by some store. If they do ${z_i}$ is always set to 1 and i don\u0027t want it to be necessary set to 1 if the resource set is covered. What i need is to add some logic that will force the objective function to choose weather to open ${z_i}$ and what ${y_j}$ and ${x_{ij}}$ should be set to 0/1 in order to maximize the objective function.\n","viewCount":46,"score":0,"creationDate":"2017-03-27T23:24:50.240","acceptedAnswerId":72139,"postTypeId":1,"postId":72138},{"favoriteCount":0,"answerCount":1,"tagList":["algorithms","complexity-theory","optimization"],"tags":"algorithms complexity-theory optimization ","postTitle":"Minimizing transportation cost through a network, multiple source/sinks","ownerUserId":34021,"postBody":"I have the following problem:\n\n\n  Inputs:\n  \n  \n  A finite collection $V$ of vertices\n  A metric cost function $c:V^2\\to\\Bbb R$ (interpreted as the edge cost of a complete graph on $V$)\n  An amount of resource $s:V\\to\\Bbb R$ on each vertex, satisfying $\\sum_{u\\in V}s(u)\u003d0$\n  \n  \n  The problem is to determine a transfer function $f:V^2\\to\\Bbb R^{\\ge0}$ such that $\\sum_{v\\in V}(f(v,u)-f(u,v))\u003ds(u)$ for all $u$, which minimizes $\\sum_{u,v}f(u,v)c(u,v)$.\n\n\nThe story to tell is that the points represent places with some amount of resource (if $s(u)$ is positive) or with some need of the resource (if $s(u)$ is negative), and $c(u,v)$ is the cost of sending a unit of resource from $u$ to $v$.

Since this is equivalent to a, then we can say a -\u0026gt; ((b -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r) \u003d a -\u0026gt; (b -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r is then equivalent to a -\u0026gt; b\n\nI think this is standard issue for the continuation monad, but if we play with it in another direction, we can have other interesting results; for example we could say:\n\n(a, b) \u003d (a -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r\nEither a b \u003d (a -\u0026gt; r, b -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r \u003d (a -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; (b -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r\n\n\nI find what\u0027s going on here interesting because this has immediate applications in a language like, say C++, where it\u0027s annoying to work with product and sum types. So, if you need to return an Either a b (a + b) but you don\u0027t want to express that type, you can instead just accept a -\u0026gt; r and b -\u0026gt; r and return r. If your caller actually needs Either a b she can package it up herself with a suitable choice of r.\n\nAnd that\u0027s not limited to sum and product types either, for instance if you want to return a list of values, but if you don\u0027t want to get your hands dirty with memory allocation, you can instead resort to the definition of a list as:\n\nList a \u003d  Nil | a (List a)\nList a \u003d (r   , a -\u0026gt; r -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r \u003d r -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; r -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r\n\n\nThat means instead of returning a list, you can instead accept an initial value and a fold. Again, if you\u0027re in C++, you either avoid memory allocation entirely if the caller will just fold the list with a known-size type or you will at least delegate the dirty work of memory allocation to her. This formulation easily extends to any algebraic data type using its catamorphism.\n\nThen I\u0027ve started wondering what you could do if you needed to return two lists. This is what I could come up with:\n\n(List a, List b) \u003d r1 -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; r1 -\u0026gt; r1) -\u0026gt; (r1 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; (b -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; r2\n\n\nThat is, if you want to receive in1 as input and return two lists:\n\nin1 -\u0026gt; (List a, List b) \u003d in1 -\u0026gt; r1 -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; r1 -\u0026gt; r1) -\u0026gt; (r1 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; (b -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; r2\n\n\nThis one looks a little bit trickier, but the initial r1 -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; r1 -\u0026gt; r1) is for the first list, so you let the caller fold the first list. Then (r1 -\u0026gt; r2) is for starting the fold for the second list using the result of the first fold. The remaining (b -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; r2 is for folding the second list.\n\nAt this point, I realize that there are a lot of variations that are equivalent to (List a, List b), and I\u0027m not even sure if my substitute for (List a, List b) is even a real equivalence, or if it\u0027s the most natural one in whatever sense. For instance, this is also an alternative:\n\n(List a, List b) \u003d r1 -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; r1 -\u0026gt; r1) -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; (b -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; r2) -\u0026gt; (r1 -\u0026gt; r2 -\u0026gt; r) -\u0026gt; r\n\n\nSo, my question is: What the hell am I doing?

Given a number written on the index tape, the RAM-TM takes constant time to move the head of the memory tape to the location indicated on the index tape. We also allow the RAM-TM to have a few other tapes for easily doing arithmetics. The RAM-TM has no notion of memory allocation. This seems to be a simplification of the various (Transdichotomous or word) RAM machines out there.\nEven if I must confess I do not really know the exact technical details of all theoretical machines RAM (or RASP), it is possible to work with an exponentially-large memory area and yet use only a polynomially large number of cells and my algorithm is not the first doing this. This also happens in the binary search algorithm over a sorted array: $n$ cells but only $O(log(n))$ time complexity. This scientific paper introduced a data structure that uses a large memory area but has constant time access, \nsee also the answer of zotachidil to this question. My algorithm could work with this data structure instead of explicitly reserving space.\nsee Ps 1.\n\nGo through the $m$ numbers in the input and for each one of them $x$ assign $[x]\u003d0$, where $[x]$ is the memory slot/location number $x$ in the above reserved memory area.\nGo through the $m$ numbers in the input and for each one of them $x$ assign $[x]\u003d[x]+1$.\nTake the first number $x$ in the input and assign $outVal\u003dx$ and $maxFreq\u003d[x]$. \nScan again the $m$ numbers and for each number $x$ perform: if $[x]\u0026gt;maxFreq$, set $outVal\u003dx$ and $maxFreq\u003d[x]$.\nOutput $outVal$.\n\n\nThe algorithm has time complexity $O(mn)$ assuming $n\\hskip 0.7mm \\not \\hskip -0.7mm \\ll m$ at least on the RAM-TM (see ps 2.), i.e., linear. It is certainly not the only algorithm to solve the problem, but I do not know any other linear algorithm using polynomial memory.\n\nHowever, the big problem is that the algorithm would require exponential time in a Turing machine, no? Does this contradict one of the Extended/Complexity-Theoretic Churchâ€“Turing Theses? The section \"Variations\" of the Wikipedia article on the Churchâ€“Turing thesis states that \"polynomial-time overhead and constant-space overhead could be simultaneously achieved for a simulation of a Random Access Machine on a Turing machine [55]\", where [55] is \"C. Slot, P. van Emde Boas, On tape versus core: an application of space efficient perfect hash functions to the invariance of space, STOC, December 1984\". Something seems inconsistent. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nps 1. A real-machine argument for the fact one can allocate $O(2^n)$ bits in constant time. Notice I did not say the $2^n$ cells are initialized to some zero values. In a programming language like C this should be achieved by an instruction malloc instead of calloc. In my comment to D.W.\u0027s answer, I provide a reference for a real-life memory allocator that \"performs the allocation/deallocation in constant time\". However, D.W. seem to reject this argument, claiming the above \"constant time\" is calculated by ignoring the fact that we can have $n\\to \\infty$ since in practice $n$ does no go to $\\infty$, if I understood the response. As for me, it is hard to believe this \"constant time\" is actually $O(2^n)$, constant time is really far from $O(2^n)$. I would be surprised to see such large approximations in a paper published by Real-Time Systems. \n\nps 2. Not really essential, but a technical edit: because of Step 5, the complexity of the algorithm should be $O(nm+m\\cdot log(m))$ on a RAM-TM and not $O(nm)$, which is relevant only if $n$ is very very small compared to $m$. \n","viewCount":141,"score":2,"creationDate":"2017-07-20T21:05:58.200","acceptedAnswerId":0,"postTypeId":1,"postId":78145},{"favoriteCount":1,"answerCount":0,"tagList":["memory-management","virtual-memory","memory-access","memory-allocation"],"tags":"memory-management virtual-memory memory-access memory-allocation ","postTitle":"When there\u0027s no memory, should malloc or read/write fail?","ownerUserId":11551,"postBody":"To my surprise, I recently found out that Windows would fail a large memory allocation even if little of said memory is to actually be used, e.g. even if you don\u0027t want the swap, you better not disable it.  http://brandonlive.com/2010/02/21/measuring-memory-usage-in-windows-7/  (Basically, in Windows 7, Windows Task Manager, Performance, System, Commit, -- the sum of the physical memory plus the swap file is depicted, and a mere allocation of 2GB will immediately grow the figure by 2GB, unless such growth is restricted (e.g. if the page file is disabled), then the whole allocation would fail.)\n\nI recall that it\u0027s also the case with OpenVZ virtualisation, which behaves the same way, thus being incompatible with Java, for example.

I have a website (system) that receives database updates later returned in queries made to the same system. In order to speed up the system the obvious solution is to cache data in different places. I have identified the most likely places where caching may be useful, but caching in every case is clearly not practical. I have begun to decompose the times it takes to place data in different caches. I will end up with.\n\nCu \u003d uth computation time\nSu \u003d storage required to store result of uth computation\nSCn \u003d storage cost using nth storage resource\nWn \u003d storage cache write time for nth storage resource\nRn \u003d storage cache read time for nth storage resource\n\n\nI understand that there are multiple caches inside today\u0027s microprocessors, but I want to ignore those for now. I actually have several options for storage. I can buy plenty of SSD, Spinning drives and/or RAM. But given the amount of possible caching I want to buy what makes most sense.\n\nI am trying to come up with a cost function, storage seems to be pretty straight forward since there will be an allocated space that will cost X dollars. I am struggling a bit more with timing. Clearly I could minimize the time it takes to query and update. But that does not seem correct. I need responsiveness, we need servers to be responsive with every request not to be able to process every single update and query at once in a couple of days, instead of three. I am constructing a $$ to seconds function. This function would imply, we are willing to pay $X for a computer that responds in Y seconds.\n\nI will also need an optimization algorithm, there are a lot out there and I am not sure which could be a good fit for this problem.\n\nI am having a lot of difficulty finding research similar to this description. And I do know I will need to redo this optimization a number of times, so I will end up writing code so I don\u0027t have to do this every time.\n","viewCount":137,"score":3,"creationDate":"2013-09-03T18:39:54.083","acceptedAnswerId":0,"postTypeId":1,"postId":14109},{"favoriteCount":0,"answerCount":1,"tagList":["optimization","reference-request","discrete-mathematics","matroids"],"tags":"optimization reference-request discrete-mathematics matroids ","postTitle":"What is a good resource to learn about oriented matroids in the context of digraphs and optimization?","ownerUserId":472,"postBody":"I am interested in oriented matroids in the context of directed graphs and optimization.
